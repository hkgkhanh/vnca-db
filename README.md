# VNCA DB
statics json files for all VNCA (non WCA) results exports

The data is updated on the 1st, 6th, 12th, 18th, 24th, and 30th of each month. Therefore, the rankings should be updated after these days, not after the comp.

## Why?
We are developing a website for the Vietnam Cube Association, organization and community. Similar to the [Unofficial WCA API](https://wca-rest-api.robiningelbrecht.be/) or the [WCA API v0](https://docs.worldcubeassociation.org/knowledge_base/v0_api.html), we create a data center for the results of unofficial comps in Vietnam. This solution lets us serve data quickly without needing a paid database service.
